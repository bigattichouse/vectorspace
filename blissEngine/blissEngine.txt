initial version - discrete queries against three files
later - a running server .. started with the bliss and memory, then just keep feeding in the now.

[entity].bliss file describes the vectors/states that define bliss.

so, a single vector.


[entity].memory file which contains the memory structure for this entity

memory
  stories
    vectors


[entity].now contains the current scanned "Now"

a single vector... gets fed back into the system.


So, for testing with a web client, I can just pass in the three and read the output.

Output:

new "now"
new "now" bliss score
output vector containing the resulting action.

Doing it this way, we can have one CPU service lots of file groups... (or multiple cpus) just pass a directory and an entity id.. and it will process.
